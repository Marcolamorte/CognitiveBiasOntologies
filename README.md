# The Cognitive Bias Ontology

The Cognitive Bias Ontology is a project that aims to create a comprehensive collection of all the cognitive biases peculiar to human beings. Cognitive bias refers to a systematic (that is, nonrandom and, thus, predictable) deviation from rationality in judgment or decision-making[^1]. 

In other words, Cognitive bias is a tendency to act in an irrational way due to our limited ability to process information objectively; it is not always negative, but it can cloud our judgment and affect how clearly we perceive situations, people, or potential risks. 

For the study and understanding of each bias, the 	**Cognitive Bias Codex Wheel**, a handy visualization of the 188 cognitive biases listed by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) and shown as follows:

Next, a dedicated ontology was developed for each bias following what is defined by "the eXtreme Design approach"[^2]. The Cognitive Bias Codex Wheel is composed of 20 clusters of bias and each of them describes a specific category in which the biases act. For the development of the project, our group focused on the analysis and modeling of two of these bias clusters described as follows:

### We notice flaws in others more easily than we notice flaws in ourselves ###
+ [Bias blind spot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_blind_spot)
+ [Naïve cynicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%C3%AFve_cynicism)
+ [Naïve realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%C3%AFve_realism_(psychology))


### We tend to find stories and patterns even when looking at sparse data ###



The Cognitive Bias Ontology project is the final result of the 2023 Knowledge Representation and Extraction course held by professor Aldo Gangemi at the University of Bologna.
