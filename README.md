#The Cognitive Bias Ontology

The Cognitive Bias Ontology is a project that aims to create a comprehensive collection of all the cognitive biases peculiar to human beings. Cognitive bias refers to a systematic (that is, nonrandom and, thus, predictable) deviation from rationality in judgment or decision-making [Blanco, F. (2017). Cognitive Bias. In: Vonk, J., Shackelford, T. (eds) Encyclopedia of Animal Cognition and Behavior]. In other words, Cognitive bias is a tendency to act in an irrational way due to our limited ability to process information objectively; it is not always negative, but it can cloud our judgment and affect how clearly we perceive situations, people, or potential risks. 
For the study and understanding of each bias, the 	**Cognitive Bias Codex Wheel**, a handy visualization of the 188 cognitive biases listed by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases).
